# Tankers - A Pygame Project

## Project Overview

This project, "Tankers," is a game developed using Pygame. Its primary purpose is to reinforce the fundamentals of software programming and object-oriented programming (OOP) by implementing a fun and interactive game.

## Features

- Two-player tank game.
- Tank movement and shooting.
- Terrain generation and rendering.
- Collision detection.
- Health and score tracking.
- Game over and restart functionality.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pygame library

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Install the Pygame library using `pip`: `pip install pygame`

3. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/devorbs/tankers-game.git`

4. Navigate to the project directory: `cd tankers-game`

5. Run the game: `python main.py`


## How to Play

- Player 1 controls:
- Move Up: Up Arrow Key
- Move Down: Down Arrow Key
- Move Left: Left Arrow Key
- Move Right: Right Arrow Key
- Shoot: Enter Key (from keypad)

- Player 2 controls (if available):
- Move Up: W Key
- Move Down: S Key
- Move Left: A Key
- Move Right: D Key
- Shoot: Spacebar

## Game Rules

- The objective of the game is to destroy the opponent's tank while avoiding their attacks.
- Players can shoot bullets to attack their opponents.
- Tanks have limited health, and resets when a player's health reaches zero.
- The player who can stay alive for 3 rounds wins.

## Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by the desire to reinforce programming fundamentals through practical application. It also serves as a fun way to learn about game development and software design using Python and the Pygame library.
